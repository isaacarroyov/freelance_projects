# Freelance Projects by Isaac Arroyo
Hello, I'm Isaac, a **Freelance Data Visualization 
Designer** :computer: 📈 🖌️ my job is to help you to 
communicate information visually. I will find a way to 
design effective, aesthetic and eye-catching data 
visualization according to your needs and data. 
I work at the intersection of numbers, shapes and colours.

Even though most of my data visualizations are entirely 
made with code, I consider myself a _jack of all trades_. I 
love combining different tools; for example, my favourite 
mix is using R and Adobe Illustrator.

I love collaborating and learning from people with different 
backgrounds. Therefore, I'm highly interested in topics 
related to social sciences and human rights 🧑‍🤝‍🧑👬👭, 
the arts 🎨, public policy 🏛️ and the environment  🌱🍃.

This repository is aimed to showcase some of my 
client projects.

### Client's Privacy
Sometimes the data I'm working on is delicate or 
unavailable to the public. That's why I'm only sharing the 
design with slight changes in the labels and, sometimes, 
the colours. Nonetheless, the data visualizations displayed 
here are very close to the final result.

## 01 - Supply Chain
In this project, the client asked for a data visualization 
that could showcase the connections between different 
companies and display the revenue and the industry sector 
the companies belonged to. Also, highlight the companies with 
the highest centrality measures, such as degree and 
eigenvector centrality. The final result was a series of 
five data visualizations.

Here are the base network diagram and the network diagram 
with highlighted nodes with the highest degree centrality.

## 00 - Custom `ggplot2` theme
Creating charts with ggplot2 is not complicated; however, 
styling them is a task that requires much time. Therefore, 
the client asked for a custom ggplot2 to use it many times, 
get the same results, need little time changing details and 
could save time.

Here's the theme with some "dummy" data visualization 
examples of charts that the client often uses.
